# vBlockchain_go

I followed the steps 1-7 to make a simple bitcoin style blockchain from https://github.com/Jeiwan/blockchain_go.

Thanks to [author Jeiwan](https://github.com/Jeiwan), it is a quick way to understand blockchain principles from coding.

Now there are some bugs in my code, I will fix them and add some features:

1.Dockerlize nodes

2.Use IPFS to build p2p network

3.Try some other consensus alternatives, such as POS or DPOS.
